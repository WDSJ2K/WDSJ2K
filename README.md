# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/WDSJ2K/">William Spencer Jr</a>'s Network & Cloud Security Portfolio 🔐

I'm pursuing a networking-focused IT degree with the goal of working in a Network Operations Center (NOC). My interests center on routing, switching, wireless networking, and network monitoring. These projects showcase hands-on labs aligned with CCNA and Network+ objectives, where I practice configuring network devices, troubleshooting connectivity issues, analyzing traffic, and maintaining reliable network operations.
